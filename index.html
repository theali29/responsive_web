          Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
          traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for
          example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is
          whether education is value-free or involves an improvement of the
          student. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to
          distinguish education from indoctrination. These disagreements affect
          how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The term can
          also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people.
          Additionally, it can mean the academic field studying education.

          Education in Pakistan is overseen by the Federal Ministry of Education
          and the provincial governments, whereas the federal government mostly
          assists in curriculum development, accreditation and the financing of
          research and development. Article 25-A of the Constitution of Pakistan
          obligates the state to provide free and compulsory quality education
          to children of the age group 5 to 16 years.

          History of Education in the Indian subcontinent
        </p>
        <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">
          Education in the Indian subcontinent began with teaching of
          traditional elements such as Indian religions, Indian mathematics,
          Indian logic at early Hindu and Buddhist centres of learning such as
          ancient Takshashila (in modern-day Pakistan) and Nalanda (in India).
          Islamic education became ingrained with the establishment of Islamic
          empires in the Indian subcontinent in the Middle Ages while the coming
          of the Europeans later brought western education to colonial India.
          Several Western-style universities were established during the period
          of British rule in the 19th century. A series of measures continuing
          throughout the early half of the 20th century ultimately laid the
          foundation of the educational system of the Republic of India,
          Pakistan and much of the Indian subcontinent.
